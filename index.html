        Hello! If you have stumbled across this site for whatever reason, you
        have found my desperate attempt to keep education in my life,
        post-graduation. As they say, never stop learning. So, that is exactly
        what I am trying to do. I am treating this site as a hub for all of my
        self-taught classes so I can easily navigate around University of Megan.
      </p>
